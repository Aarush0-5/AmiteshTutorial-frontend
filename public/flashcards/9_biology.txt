    "question": "What is a cell?",
    "answer": "The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living beings. It is the smallest part of the body of an organism which is capable of independent existence and of performing the essential functions of life. Every organ in our body-the skin, the brain, the muscle or even the bone-is composed of hundreds of thousands of such cells. Similarly, every part of a plant-the leaf, the flower, the root and even the wood-is composed of an exceedingly large number of cells. Every cell has its own life. Old and weak cells in the body continually die and are replaced by new cells. Red blood cells for instance die after about 120 days. Most organisms, including ourselves, start life as a single cell called the zygote."

    "question": "What do you understand about THE INVENTION OF THE MICROSCOPE AND THE DISCOVERY OF CELL?",
    "answer": "The first microscope was constructed by Dutch scientist Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). He was an ordinary public official who ground lenses and made microscopic observations as a hobby. He is said to have constructed 400 microscopes. Basically, all his microscopes were called simple microscopes because they consisted of a single biconvex lens. Some of these microscopes had a considerable magnifying power up to 200 times. Robert Hooke (1635-1703), an English scientist, developed a microscope by using two lenses. The ordinary compound microscope uses light which is bent by glass lenses to magnify the image while the electron microscope uses beams of electrons which are bent by magnets."

    "question": "What was cell theory?",
    "answer": "In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German Botanist, announced that every plant is made up of a large number of cells. He added that each of these cells performed various life processes. A year later, Theodor Schwann, a German zoologist, made similar discoveries in animals. He declared that all animals and plants are composed of cells, which serve as the units of structure and function. This, in short, is called the Cell Theory, having been proposed by Schwann and Schleiden in the year 1839."

    "question": "How many cells are there in organisms?",
    "answer": "Single-celled: Many small plants and animals are made up of just one single cell. Examples: Bacteria, yeast, amoeba. Few-celled: Some very small plants and animals are made up of a relatively fewer number of cellsâ€” just a few hundred or a few thousand cells. Examples: Spirogyra, Volvox. Multi-celled: Most plants and animals we see around us including ourselves, are made up of millions and billions of cells. Examples: Human beings, Mango trees."

  {
    "question": "What is the size of the cell?",
    "answer": "Cells are very small and are seen only with a microscope. Smallest cells are the bacteria (0.3-5.0 micrometre), red blood cells (about 7 micrometre) in the human body. Longest cells are the nerve cells. Imagine a nerve cell extending from your finger tip up to the spinal cord inside your backbone. Largest cells are the birds' eggs (actually the central yellow sphere). Ostrich egg (before development begins in it) is the largest single cell of the living world today."

  {
    "question": "What is the shape of the cell?",
    "answer": "White blood cells are amoeboid (amoeba-like movement, with pseudopodia) that can squeeze out through capillary walls. Nerve cells are long to conduct \"impulses\" from distant parts of the body to the brain and vice-versa. Muscle cells are long and contractile to pull or squeeze the parts. Guard cells of stomatal pore in the leaves are bean-shaped to open and close the pore. Human red blood cells are circular and biconcave, to pass through narrow capillaries and transport oxygen."

  {
    "question": "What is the structure of the cell?",
    "answer": "Various kinds of cells show special differences, yet they all show a basic structural plan which is dealt under the term \"generalised cell\". A generalised cell consists of three essential parts: (1) cell membrane (plasma membrane), (2) nucleus, and (3) cytoplasm. Cell organelles (the \"little organs\"): Most parts of a cell have a definite shape, a definite structure, and a definite function. Such parts are called organelles. The organelles have the same status in a cell as the organs have in the entire body of an animal or a plant performing specific functions. Cell organelles are living parts."

  {
    "question": "Difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell.",
    "answer": "Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and more complex, while prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler."

  {
    "question": "What is protoplasm?",
    "answer": "Protoplasm is the living substance inside the cell, which includes the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and the cell membrane. It is the site of various biochemical processes that are essential for the cell's survival."
  },
  
  {
    "question": "Distinguish between Animal and Plant cells.",
    "answer": "Animal cells do not have a cell wall, chloroplasts, or large central vacuoles, whereas plant cells do. Animal cells have irregular shapes, while plant cells typically have a fixed, rectangular shape. Animal cells also have smaller vacuoles."
  },
  
  {
    "question": "Distinguish between Granules and vacuoles",
    "answer": "Granules are small particles found in cells, often serving as storage sites for substances. Vacuoles are membrane-bound spaces in the cell that store water, nutrients, or waste products. Plant cells usually have large central vacuoles, while animal cells have smaller vacuoles."
